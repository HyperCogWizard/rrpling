I'd be happy to articulate a directory structure for a repository or wiki that explores the Gizmos concepts. This structure will organize the content in a way that allows for deep exploration while maintaining clear relationships between different aspects of these cognitive architectures.

Let me create this for you:

```

This structure organizes content in a way that:

1. Begins with core concepts that span across all the Gizmos
2. Provides detailed explorations of each architecture
3. Offers practical implementation guidance
4. Explores applications and integration possibilities
5. Opens up research directions for further exploration

The structure is designed to be approachable for newcomers while providing depth for those wanting to delve into specific aspects. It also facilitates comparing and contrasting different approaches to similar problems across the various architectures.

Would you like me to expand on any particular section of this structure, or would you prefer suggestions for specific content that could populate some of these directories?
